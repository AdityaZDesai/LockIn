Okay, I think that'll work, and I'll start the lecture. It's a minute or so early, but I've got some\u2014but it is being recorded now, so I'll just cover stuff from yesterday, and you'll notice that yesterday's slides have now been updated to include all those native languages and favourite programming languages that you suggested yesterday, so there it is. But more importantly, I want to cover again the stuff I did right at the end, some of which was cut off in the recording. So you'll recall I was talking about proofs\u2014proofs of existential statements, proofs of universal statements. We covered that, alright? I think the thing that was missing was this last theorem and proof that the language double word was a subset of the language even-even. And we talked about how what you can't do when you want to prove something is just appeal to the intuitively compelling example that you have. Examples are great for conveying ideas and understandings, helping with teaching. We will use lots of them through this semester. But giving an example that illustrates the core idea of something may be convincing at a human level, but it's not of itself a rigorous proof. For a rigorous proof, you need to come up with a watertight, correct, logical argument that covers all cases. So let's try and do that now with this theorem that double word is a subset of even-even. And this is an illustration of the general proof strategy that you will use if you want to show that one set is a subset of another, or more specifically in this unit, that one language is a subset of another. So what do we need to do to prove that? Well, if I want to prove that A is a subset of B, what is that statement? That is just the assertion that every member of A is also a member of B. Or to put it a bit more extensively, everything that satisfies the condition of membership of A must also satisfy the condition of membership of B. So you need to start out by being really clear about what those conditions are, because you will need to use those conditions. You'll need to start with something satisfying the conditions of A, and then work with those conditions in a systematic, logical, step-by-step way to end up showing that they imply logically that your object also satisfies B. And to do that, you're going to be reasoning about something. It needs to be something that covers all objects in your set. So you need to start with some general member of set A, and you need to give it a name. So we'll call it, in this case, we'll call it W. We want to show that double-word is a subset of even-even. So let W be a subset of double-word, and don't underestimate the power of simply giving something a name. As soon as you have a name for something, that is something you can write about, refer to, and reason about, and refer back to later in your proof. It's a simple step, but actually a really important and empowering one. Okay, so we've got a name for a general member of double-word. We're not going to assume any more about W than that it satisfies the basic condition of membership of W, which is, and this is where we start using that condition, this is that it's a concatenation of two identical strings. Give them a name, X. So W equals XX for some word X. This is just a restatement of the condition that W must satisfy if it is to be a member of double-word. Okay, so we've got W, we've got XX, same thing. Now we can reason about the number of As and Bs in W, because that's what we need to study to investigate whether it satisfies the condition of membership of even-even. Even-even is defined in terms of numbers of As and numbers of Bs, requiring that they are both even numbers and remembering, as we mentioned yesterday, that zero is an even number. So let's look at those numbers. The number of As in W, well, what is that given that W must have this form? It's twice the number of As in X. That's evident from the structure of W. But anything that's twice something is an even number. Similarly, let's work out the number of Bs in W. Well, same argument, really, that's twice the number of Bs in X, because we doubled X to get W. So that also is an even number. So the numbers of As and Bs in W are both even, W satisfies the condition of membership of even-even, so W is a member of even-even, and the proof is complete. It's as simple as it is. That represents the main ingredients of any proof, the high-level structure of any proof about a containment relation, a subset relation between sets. And there's a good illustration of applying this in another couple of languages that we use in this unit as exercise two in next week's exercise sheet. So have a look at that. Use the same kind of thinking we've illustrated here to tackle your exercise two for next week's applied class. Okay. Topics that we're going to look at in this unit, it's all on the slides, references, excuse me, in the recommended text. So that's the end of lecture one. Any questions about lecture one? Okay. All right. Well, it's all recorded. Hopefully that capturing that in the recording means that nobody's missed out on anything from yesterday. I'll now go to start lecture two, today's lecture. Right. Okay. Here it is, propositional logic. So today we will look at propositions, which are basic statements that are true or false. We will look at combining them using logical operations. We'll look at the notion of when a proposition is always true and when two propositions are always the same in a logical sense. Then we'll look at some standard forms in which propositional expressions can always be expressed. They are disjunctive normal form or DNF and conjunctive normal form or CNF. And then we'll discuss the issue of representing statements that you might be given in English text as logical statements involving propositions. And that's a really important skill because the whole point of doing all this with propositions and the algebra of combining them and reasoning with them is so that you can reason with things that represent something useful in the real world that you want to work with. Okay. So what's a proposition? It's a statement that is either true or false. So examples, one plus one equals two. Please don't go home and tell your family or housemates that that's what we studied today, but just between us, one plus one equals two, a proposition which is true. So that's a proposition. One plus one equals three. Don't quote me on that. One plus one equals three. Is that a proposition? Yes. Let's take a vote. If you think it's a proposition, lift your arm up this way at this angle. If you think it's not a proposition, simultaneously arm up that way. Preferably nobody with both arms up. Yeah. Okay. So computer science by democracy. This side has it. It is still a proposition. It's false. That doesn't stop it being a proposition. It just stops it being a true proposition. That's one plus one equals three. The earth is flat. Another proposition which is false. You could say I'm overemphasizing false propositions so far. It will rain tomorrow. That's a proposition too. It's a statement. It's either true or false. We may not know the answer to it. We may not know whether it's true or false, but it is true or false. So it's one or the other.
